# regulatory-ai-delhi-electricity-bot

Most legal/energy chatbots hallucinate law, mix jurisdictions, or give unsafe advice.
This project demonstrates how to build a citation-locked, refusal-safe regulatory AI
using real government documents and reproducible pipelines.

Processed regulatory corpora (cleaned TXT files) are not committed.

They are generated from public DERC PDFs using the included pipeline.
This repository publishes the pipeline, not the artifacts.
